## What is Monkey Bonanza?
Monkey Bananza is a local multiplayer round based party game in which a gas leak in a laboratory turned all scientists into crazy monkeys willing to destroy everything! Will the janitor be able to prevent them to do so?

**Play as monkeys** and team up to destroy the lab. You can also grab power ups and free each others or turn selfish and stun your peers to be the one scoring the highest.

**Play as the janitor** and protect your lab by capturing all the turbulent monkeys and place them in a cage. Beware, there is only so much oxygen in your bottle and you will have to refill at the oxygen tanks.
Capturing monkeys and destroying the lab both yield points. The player with the highest score at the end takes the game.
