## What is P.L.A.N.T.?
Plants is a couch arcade game where you have to fight your friends in an everchanging arena.
Try to survive while using power-ups to get your fellow plants under a falling block or drown in the rising water.
The first plant that wins 5 rounds, wins the game.

## My role during the development
My role was a developer. This project was made over the span of 3 weeks. This included coming up with a pitch, developing the game, implementing feedback and creating a trailer.
I focused on creating the local multiplayer support, alongside controller support. 
I learned to use the new player input system from Unity, while using CineMachine with a adaptive splitscreen setup.


This projet was part of an incubator program called DAE Studios
